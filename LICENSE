Usage:
   srp-entry [-i index] [clientname]

Index, if supplied, is the modulus/generator index from
/etc/tpasswd.conf.  If not supplied, then the last (highest
numbered) entry from that file is used.  If the file doesn't exist,
then the default "well known" EAP SRP-SHA1 modulus/generator is
used.

The default modulus/generator can be requested as index 0.

This implementation of EAP supports MD5-Challenge and SRP-SHA1
authentication styles.  Note that support of MD5-Challenge is a
requirement of RFC 2284, and that it's essentially just a
reimplementation of regular RFC 1994 CHAP using EAP messages.

As an authenticator ("server"), there are multiple phases for each
style.  In the first phase of each style, the unauthenticated peer
name is queried using the EAP Identity request type.  If the
"remotename" option is used, then this phase is skipped, because
the peer's name is presumed to be known.

For MD5-Challenge, there are two phases, and the second phase
consists of sending the challenge itself and handling the
associated response.

For SRP-SHA1, there are four phases.  The second sends 's', 'N',
and 'g'.  The reply contains 'A'.  The third sends 'B', and the
reply contains 'M1'.  The forth sends the 'M2' value.

As an authenticatee ("client"), there's just a single phase --
responding to the queries generated by the peer.  EAP is an
authenticator-driven protocol.

Based on draft-ietf-pppext-eap-srp-03.txt.
